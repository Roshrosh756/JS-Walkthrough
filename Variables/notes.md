Javascript variables can be declared in 4 ways :
### Automatically
### Using var
### Using let
### Using const

When to use var, let, or const?
1.Always declare varaiable
2 Always use const if the value should not be changed
3.Only use let if you can't use const

Examples:
# let
 let age = 45;
 console.log(age);      // Output : 45

 # const
 const pi = 3.14;
 console.log(pi);        // Output: 3.14

 # var
  var name = Roshni;
  console.var(name);      // Output: Roshni

  ## Data types
   In data types i learned about primitive types
Number – e.g. 5, 3.14
String – e.g. "hello"
Boolean – e.g. true or false
undefined – variable declared but not assigned
null – intentionally empty
BigInt – large integers
Symbol – unique identifiers

## Reference types
Here I leanrned about array , object, and function.

let greet = function() {
  console.log("Hi");
};

We are using a function expression and assigning it to a variab;e named greet.



# Variables Rules

Variables names are case sesitive i.e. "a" and "A" are different.
Only letter, digits, underscore (_) , or $ are allowed. [Not even space]
Only letters, underscore (_), or $ should be 1st character.
Reserved words cannot be variable names

for eg: let var = 9; // var is wrong , it's a error

        let num == 9; // num is correct
